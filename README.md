Introduction
This is my first professional code being oushed to my GitHub account. It is a folder containing the codes used in developing my portfolio website. Taking inspiration from FreeCodeCamp tutorials on YouTube, I was able to come up with this to serve as a fully functioning personal website.

Parts
There are about 5 different parts of this website with each hosting different sections of the website. They are distinctively created and developed to host and contain different segment of the website as well as perform varying functions. The 5 sections include:
a. The Home Page
b. The About Me Page
c. The Portfolio Page
d. The Blog Page
e. The Contact Me Page.

Each of these sections are important section of the portfolio website as they make visitors feel at home and understand my core skills. The section also gives major insights and overlying knowledge of whom I am and what I do to prospective clients and partners. 

NB: The portfolio website is still in its development phase as there are still a lot of work to be done on it and as such, contributions are welcome. I am looking to hosting the website soon and actually purchase a domain for the website as I intend to continually use this website to develop my brand and market myself to the uttermost part of the world. 
Thanks to my inspirations and all the excellent developers all around the world for paving ways for we upcoming developers to make headway on this journey. Y'all are the MVPs.
